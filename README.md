# Getting Started with ADAS

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are technologies designed to improve driving safety, reduce human error, and support the path toward fully autonomous vehicles. This repo is a simple and structured place to learn the core concepts behind ADAS, the sensors used, how AI fits in, and how modern safety features work.

## What is ADAS

ADAS includes systems that monitor the surroundings of a vehicle, support the driver, and prevent accidents. These systems rely on multiple sensors, real‑time processing, and intelligent decision‑making.

## Course Overview

In this repo, you will find notes and explanations based on the **Udemy** course content, organized into clear sections:

### ADAS Introduction

- Road Safety
- Why ADAS
- How ADAS Help Drivers
- General Working of ADAS
- Role of ADAS towards AD

### Sensors in ADAS

- Automotive Radar
- Camera Vision System
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Lidar Sensor
- GNSS, GPS and IMU

| Sensor Type              | Description                                                        |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Radar**                | Measures distance and velocity of objects. Used for ACC, FCW, BSD. |
| **Camera (Mono/Stereo)** | Recognizes lanes, signs, objects, pedestrians.                     |
| **Lidar**                | High‑resolution 3D mapping for AD and advanced perception.         |
| **Ultrasonic**           | Short‑range detection for parking assist.                          |
| **GNSS / GPS**           | Provides global positioning.                                       |
| **IMU**                  | Measures acceleration and rotation for vehicle state estimation.   |

### Resources and Projects

Additional learning resources are stored in the `Resources` folder, such as books, technical papers, and reference materials on ADAS and autonomous driving. These materials can help you deepen your understanding beyond the course content.

Optional Python programming activities and practical exercises are provided in the `Projects` folder. They cover computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning tasks related to ADAS, with 7 guided exercises including problem statements for self-practice.

You can explore them here:

- [Coding Activity 1 - Development of Lane Detection System for ADAS Application](./Projects/Coding%20Activity%201)
- [Coding Activity 2 - Development of Traffic Sign Recognition System for ADAS](./Projects/Coding%20Activity%202)
- [Coding Activity 3 - Development of Speed Limit Recognition System for ADAS](./Projects/Coding%20Activity%203)
- [Coding Activity 4 - Object Detection from Camera Images using YOLOv3](./Projects/Coding%20Activity%204)
- [Coding Activity 5 - Street Light Detection and Recognition for ADAS](./Projects/Coding%20Activity%205)
- [Coding Activity 6 - Instrument Cluster (GUI) Development using Python](./Projects/Coding%20Activity%206)
- [Coding Activity 7 - Let's Put All Together](./Projects/Coding%20Activity%207)

Each activity includes a detailed problem statement and full implementation code to help you practice and apply the concepts learned in the course.
