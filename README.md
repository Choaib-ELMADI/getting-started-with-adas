# Getting Started with ADAS

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are technologies designed to improve driving safety, reduce human error, and support the path toward fully autonomous vehicles. This repo is a simple and structured place to learn the core concepts behind ADAS, the sensors used, how AI fits in, and how modern safety features work.

## What is ADAS

ADAS includes systems that monitor the surroundings of a vehicle, support the driver, and prevent accidents. These systems rely on multiple sensors, real‑time processing, and intelligent decision‑making.

## Course Overview

In this repo, you will find notes and explanations based on the **Udemy** course content, organized into clear sections:

### 1. Introduction

- What ADAS is
- Course outline and learning path

### 2. ADAS Basics

- General definition of ADAS with examples
- Common ADAS block diagram
- Role of ADAS in autonomous driving
- Examples of modern AD‑capable vehicles
- SAE Autonomous Driving Levels
- Key terms: ego vehicle, target vehicle, coordinate systems, field of view, blind spots

### 3. ADAS Sensors

Modern ADAS relies on a combination of sensors:

| Sensor Type              | Description                                                        |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Radar**                | Measures distance and velocity of objects. Used for ACC, FCW, BSD. |
| **Camera (Mono/Stereo)** | Recognizes lanes, signs, objects, pedestrians.                     |
| **Lidar**                | High‑resolution 3D mapping for AD and advanced perception.         |
| **Ultrasonic**           | Short‑range detection for parking assist.                          |
| **GNSS / GPS**           | Provides global positioning.                                       |
| **IMU**                  | Measures acceleration and rotation for vehicle state estimation.   |
