## Coding Activity 5 - Street Light Detection and Recognition for ADAS

### Description:

- This ADAS is not yet widely available but is going to be in near future.
- Many times, while driving, person can either miss the traffic light or can misunderstand it due to various reasons.

### Problem Statement:

- Use Python (or any other programming language) for development.
- Either use the YOLOv3 as stated in previous coding activity and then filter only class of street lights from all the objects as output. Then, further apply color detection or other algorithm to recognize, which color street lamp is currently active (RED, AMBER or GREEN) or DEACTIVE.
- OR, use some dataset of various street lights (if available) and train the CNN based Deep NN which can directly output the 4 classes as RED, AMBER, GREEN or DEACTIVE (if street lamp is off).
- Once the system is developed, test it with some random images and / or video feed of road.
