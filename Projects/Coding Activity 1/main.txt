Coding Activity 1 - Development of Lane Detection System for ADAS Application

* Description:
    . Lane detection system uses front camera of the ego vehicle.
    . It detect the lanes and also determine the lane in which the Ego vehicle is moving.
    . Lane detection is important algorithm for ADAS systems like Lane Departure Warning, Lane Change Assist, Lane Keep Assist, etc.

* Problem Statement:
    . Use Python (or any other programming language) for development.
    . Use openCV for computer vision and then required machine Learning / Deep Learning algorithm of your choice.
    . Download a video from public dataset like KITTI, nuscenes or other, which contains recording of road from front camera where lanes are clearly visible.
    . Implement the Lane detection system and validate it.
    . Test the algorithm on the video by continuously detecting road lanes.
