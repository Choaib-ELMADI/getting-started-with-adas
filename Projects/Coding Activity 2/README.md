## Coding Activity 2 - Development of Traffic Sign Recognition System for ADAS

### Description:

- Traffic Sign Recognition system is important ADAS function because when one is driving on road, there are very high chances for driver to miss some or many traffic signs which are vital to drive properly.
- Hence, ADAS system by using mainly the front camera enabled with AI based algorithm detects and display the traffic signs detected on road to the driver on the instrument cluster of the vehicle.

### Problem Statement:

- Use Python (or any other programming language) for development.
- Use OpenCV for computer vision and then required machine learning / deep learning algorithm of your choice.
- Download the publicly available dataset of traffic sign images.
- Develop deep learning CNN model and train it using the dataset. Keep aside some part of the data for validation and testing.
- After training and validation with high accuracy, test the model on test dataset and save it for later use.
