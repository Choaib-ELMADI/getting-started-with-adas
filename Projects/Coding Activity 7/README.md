## Coding Activity 7 - Let's Put All Together

### Description:

- This is the last coding activity. In the last six activities, we have developed:

  - Lane detection
  - Traffic sign recognition
  - Speed limit recognition
  - Street lamp detection and recognition
  - GUI for instrument cluster

- In this coding activity, we will put everything together.

### Problem Statement:

- Use Python (or any other programming language) for development.
- If possible use object oriented programming as this part demands integration of multiple systems together.
- The idea is simple. Take some video feeds and then adapt all the previously implemented algorithms accordingly, so that we can detect lanes, traffic signs, speed limits, street lamps together and display them on the GUI as and when they are detected in the video.
- Test it with multiple video feeds.
