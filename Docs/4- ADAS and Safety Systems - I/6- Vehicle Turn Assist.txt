1. Vehicle Turn Assist:
    . Prevents collisions during low-speed turns at intersections.
    . Detects approaching vehicles, cyclists, or pedestrians that the driver may not see when turning left or right.

2. Function Principle:
    . Monitors parallel traffic coming from the right (same direction).
    . Monitors oncoming traffic from the front (opposite direction).

3. Activation Trigger:
    . Automatically activates when the turn indicator (left or right) is switched on.
    . Works primarily at low speeds (typically < 10-15 km/h).

4. Driver Assistance Actions:
    . Visual warning (dashboard icon, HUD highlight).
    . Audio beep or warning tone.
    . Automatic emergency braking if collision is imminent and driver continues turning.
