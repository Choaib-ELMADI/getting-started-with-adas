1. Blind Spot Detection (BSD):
    . Alerts the driver to vehicles or objects in the blind spots on both sides.
    . Prevents dangerous lane changes by detecting fast-approaching or already-present traffic in adjacent lanes.

2. Types of BSD Systems:
    . BSW (Blind Spot Warning): Only alerts the driver (visual + audio).
    . BSW with AES: Can actively steer back to prevent lane change if driver ignores warnings.

3. Driver Alerts:
    . Visual: Illuminated icon in the side mirror, A-pillar, or dashboard.
    . Audio: Beeps or chimes (especially when turn signal is on).
    . Tactile: Steering wheel vibration (some manufacturers).
