    . Predicts potential front-end collisions by monitoring distance, relative speed, and ego vehicle speed.

    . Tailgating / insufficient following distance.
    . Lead vehicle slows unexpectedly without indicators.

    . Audio: Beeps or warning tones.
    . Tactile:
        - Seatbelt tightening
        - Pulsed braking
        - Headrest adjustment
