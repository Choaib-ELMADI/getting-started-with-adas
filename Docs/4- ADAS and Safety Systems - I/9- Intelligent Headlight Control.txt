1. Intelligent Headlight Control:
    . Automatically adjusts headlight mode and direction for optimal road illumination.
    . Prevents blinding oncoming traffic and vehicles ahead while ensuring maximum visibility for the driver.
    . Makes night driving safer, less tiring, and more comfortable.

2. Types of Intelligent Headlight Functions:
    . Automatic High / Low Beam Switching:
        - Switches between low and high beam based on detected traffic

    . Adaptive Cornering Lights:
        - Steers or swivels the light beam into curves according to steering angle and speed

    . Matrix / Pixel LED Headlights:
        - Selectively dims or turns off individual LED segments to create shadows around other vehicles
        - Keeping high beam on everywhere else

    . Glare-Free High Beam:
        - Maintains high-beam illumination but eliminates glare for oncoming or preceding vehicles

3. How It Works?
    . Front-facing multipurpose camera continuously monitors ambient light and detects:
        - Oncoming vehicles
        - Vehicles driving ahead
        - Street lighting conditions

    . Camera data is processed by the control unit in real time.

    . System instantly adjusts:
        - High/low beam switching
        - Beam direction (left/right swiveling)
        - Individual LED segments (in Matrix/Pixel systems)

    . Works fully automatically - no driver input needed after initial activation.
