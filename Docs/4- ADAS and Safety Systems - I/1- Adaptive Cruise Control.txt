1. Evolution of Cruise Control Systems:
    . Cruise Control (CC): Maintains set speed without accelerator pedal.
    . Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): Adds safe distance maintenance to the vehicle ahead.
    . ACC with Stop & Go: Works from high speed down to complete stop and resume.

2. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC):
    . Maintains driver-set speed when road is clear.
    . Automatically adjusts speed to keep safe distance from the vehicle in front.
    . Reduces speed when front vehicle slows down.
    . Accelerates back to set speed when path clears.

3. ACC with Stop & Go:
    . Operates in stop-and-go traffic (down to 0 km/h).
    . Can automatically resume motion within ~3 seconds after stop.
    . If stopped longer than ~3 seconds, driver must confirm resumption (button or light throttle).

4. Primary Sensor for ACC:
    . Long-Range Radar (LRR):
        - Range: typically 200-250 m
        - Horizontal field of view: ±4°
