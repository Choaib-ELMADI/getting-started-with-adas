1. Parking Assist:
    . Helps drivers park accurately and safely in tight spaces.
    . Reduces stress, prevents scratches, and minimizes low-speed parking accidents.

2. Types of Parking Assist Systems:
    . Semi-Autonomous (Active Park Assist):
        - Driver controls accelerator and brake
        - System automatically steers the vehicle into the spot
        - Driver can override or stop at any time

    . Fully Autonomous (Remote Park Assist):
        - System controls steering, acceleration, and braking
        - Can park the vehicle completely by itself

3. How It Works?
    . Driver activates the system (button or menu) and drives slowly past potential spaces.
    . System measures gaps and indicates when a suitable spot is found.
    . Driver stops, selects the space, and follows on-screen instructions.
    . System takes over steering.
