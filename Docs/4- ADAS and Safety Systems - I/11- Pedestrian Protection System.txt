1. Pedestrian Protection System:
    . Passive safety system designed to reduce pedestrian injury severity in case of frontal collision.
    . Detects impact with a pedestrian and activates external protective measures within milliseconds.
    . Focuses on minimizing head and leg trauma during vehicle-pedestrian contact.

2. Types of Protective Actions:
    . Active Hood (Pop-up Hood):
        - Lifts the rear edge of the engine hood ~10 cm using pyrotechnic actuators
        - Creates a soft deformation zone to cushion pedestrian head impact

    . External Pedestrian Airbag:
        - Deploys from base of windshield to cover lower A-pillars and wiper area
        - Reduces risk of head injury on hard windshield frame

    . Bumper Energy Absorbers / Lower Leg Protection:
        - Softens impact to pedestrian legs/shins via deformable bumper structures
