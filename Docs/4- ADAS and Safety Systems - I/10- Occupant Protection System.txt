1. Occupant Protection System:
    . Uses sensor data to detect imminent collision or critical loss-of-control situations.
    . Prepares passive safety systems in the fraction of a second before impact to maximize occupant protection.
    . Reduces injury severity by putting restraints and vehicle in the safest possible state.

2. Types of Protective Actions:
    . Reversible measures:
        - Automatically tightens front seat belts (reversible pretensioners)
        - Closes side windows and sunroof (if open)
        - Adjusts front seats/headrests to optimal position (in advanced systems)

    . Irreversible measures:
        - Triggers pyrotechnic seat-belt pretensioners
        - Deploys airbags according to crash direction and severity
        - Activates rollover protection (pop-up roll bars, curtain airbags)
