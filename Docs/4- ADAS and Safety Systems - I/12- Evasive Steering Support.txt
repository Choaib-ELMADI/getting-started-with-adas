1. Evasive Steering Support / Assist:
    . Helps the driver perform a quick, precise evasive maneuver when braking alone is not enough to avoid a collision.
    . Provides additional steering torque to guide the vehicle safely around the obstacle.
    . Significantly increases the chance of avoiding accidents in critical sudden-obstacle situations.

2. Types of Intervention:
    . Active Steering Support:
        - Adds steering power/torque in the direction the driver is already turning
        - Helps complete the swerve faster and more accurately

    . Path Guidance (advanced versions):
        - Calculates and follows an optimal collision-avoidance trajectory

3. How It Works?
    . Front camera and radar continuously monitor the road ahead for obstacles.
    . System detects an imminent collision where emergency braking alone cannot prevent impact.
    . When the driver initiates an evasive steering maneuver, the system instantly recognizes the intent.
    . Electric power steering applies additional torque to assist and stabilize the swerve.
    . Works only with driver input, it does not steer autonomously.
