1. Need of Accurate Vehicle Localisation in ADAS:
    . Many ADAS applications require accurate vehicle position for their functions.
    . Localisation is also important during the test phase of ADAS systems.

2. GNSS:
    . GNSS stands for Global Navigation Satellite System.
    . It is a group of synchronized satellites working in concert, used for position navigation and time (PNT) solutions globally.
    . Currently major satellite players in GNSS are:
        - GPS     -> USA
        - BeiDou  -> China
        - Galileo -> Europe
        - GLONASS -> Russia
        - QZSS    -> Japan

3. IMU:
    . IMU stands for Inertial Measurement Unit.
    . IMU devices usually consist of three measures: accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer.
    . They are often implemented into inertial navigation systems that process the raw IMU data to calculate more useful measures.
    . In ADAS and automotive, IMUs are useful for:
        - Increasing the accuracy of GNSS / GPS systems
        - Measuring vehicle motion like: position, velocity, and acceleration
        - Sensor calibration
