1. Introduction to LIDAR:
    . LIDAR stands for LIght Detection And Ranging.
    . LIDAR is a remote sensing technology that is used for measuring distances.
    . It uses active sensors which emit their own energy as source for illumination.
    . It works on the principle of time of flight (ToF).
    . They can produce a high-resolution densely spaced network of elevation points called "point clouds".
    . These point clouds are used to find objects in the surrounding environment of the vehicle.
