1. On-Field Testing of ADAS Systems:
    . Critical ADAS functions require highly accurate trajectory formation for both Ego vehicle and Target vehicle.
    . If the developed ADAS function fails during testing, real collision between vehicles is possible.

2. Safety Measures in ADAS On-Field Testing:
    . Ego vehicle is driven by machines that precisely control steering, accelerator pedal, brake pedal, and clutch.
    . Target vehicles are often replaced with dummy targets made of soft forming material:
        - Guided Soft Target (GST)
        - Soft Pedestrian Target (SPT)
        - Dummy alternatives also used for bicycles, motorbikes, ...

3. Robotic Control Systems Used:
    . Combined Brake and Accelerator Robot (CBAR):
        - Can be used with or without a human driver
        - Can be upgraded to control clutch and gears

    . Steering Control Robot (SCR):
        - Fully steers the vehicle without human intervention
        - Steering input comes from preset trajectory via software system
