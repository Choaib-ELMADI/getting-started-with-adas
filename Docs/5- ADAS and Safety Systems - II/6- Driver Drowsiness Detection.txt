1. Driver Drowsiness Detection System:
    . Monitors the driver for signs of fatigue or microsleep to prevent accidents caused by falling asleep at the wheel.
    . One of the earliest and still widely used ADAS safety features.

2. Two Main Detection Approaches:
    . Behavior-based (no camera needed):
        - Uses steering angle sensor + lane position data
        - Analyzes micro-corrections in steering over time
        - Detects erratic, delayed, or absent corrections typical of drowsy driving
        - Also monitors lane drifting, time of day, journey duration

    . Vision-based (uses a camera):
        - Infrared camera tracks eye closure (PERCLOS), blink rate/duration, yawning, head nodding
        - Much more accurate, especially at night (works with IR illumination)
