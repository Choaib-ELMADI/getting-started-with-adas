1. Speed Limit Assist:
    . Focused exclusively on detecting and displaying current speed limits.
    . Helps driver maintain legal speed, avoid fines, and reduce accident risk.
    . Provides real-time speed limit information even when signs are partially obscured or missed by the driver.

2. Types of Speed Limit Assist:
    . Information-only:
        - Simply displays current speed limit on instrument cluster / HUD

    . Active Speed Limiter:
        - Allows driver to set cruise control or speed limiter to the recognized speed limit automatically
        - Some versions gently resist acceleration above the limit (haptic feedback via accelerator pedal)

3. How It Works?
    . Front-facing windshield camera continuously scans for speed limit signs.
    . Image processing and deep learning algorithms detect and recognize the numerical value.
    . Recognized speed limit is shown instantly on the dashboard / head-up display.
    . System also recognizes end-of-speed-limit and zone signs (city entry/exit, ...).
    . In advanced versions, data is combined with GPS database for higher reliability.
