1. Anti-lock Braking System:
    . Prevents wheel lock-up during emergency braking.
    . Maintains steering control and reduces stopping distance on most surfaces.
    . One of the most important and proven life-saving technologies in automotive history.

2. Problem without ABS:
    . Hard braking -> wheels lock -> tires skid.
    . Vehicle slides uncontrollably.
    . Driver loses ability to steer around obstacles.
    . Longer stopping distance on dry roads due to skidding.

3. How ABS Works?
    . Wheel speed sensors monitor rotation of each wheel.
    . If a wheel is about to lock, the ABS controller rapidly modulates brake pressure.
    . Releases and re-applies brake pressure on individual wheels automatically.
    . Keeps tires at the optimum slip ratio for maximum grip.
    . Driver feels pulsation in the brake pedal - this is normal and means ABS is active.

4. Core Components of ABS:
    . Wheel Speed Sensors (one per wheel).
    . Hydraulic Valves (in brake lines - hold, release, or apply pressure).
    . Pump (restores pressure after valves release it).
    . Electronic Control Unit (ECU) - the brain that decides when to activate ABS.
