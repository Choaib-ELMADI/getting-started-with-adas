1. General Working of ADAS:
    . ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) are automation systems having different levels of autonomy.
    . In general, every ADAS system uses sensors to perceive the environment of its need.
    . Then, it does some processing to check whether the situation of road is normal or can lead to accident.
    . If it finds some danger situation, then either alert the driver or intervene to take corrective actions directly.
    . All these systems can be generally described using the following diagram:

        Environment      --> Sensors -->        Perception        --> Processing and Decision Making --> Actuators
    (in/outside vehicle)                 (information extraction)
