1. Role of ADAS towards Autonomous Driving:
    . Vehicles which can have capability of driving themselves without any driver are known as self driving vehicles.
    . Such driving is known as autonomous driving.

2. SAE Levels for Autonomous Driving:
    . SAE stands for Society of Automotive Engineers.
    . There are 6 levels (0 - 5) of automation for autonomous vehicles:
        - Level 0: No automation
        - Level 1: Driver assistance
        - Level 2: Partial automation
        - Level 3: Conditional automation
        - Level 4: High automation
        - Level 5: Full automation
